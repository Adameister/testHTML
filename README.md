## Project Overview

Dispite my background and schooling in computer science, I still am not comfortable creating a website from scratch. I want to learn how to fully design my own webpage with knowing how it works byond a shadow of a doubt. This project will mainly serve as a reference tool so I can pick up the tips and tricks of web development.

## Plans for the Future

This repository is merely a stepping stome from what is to come. I plan on adding new languages to this repository like PHP and javaScript.
